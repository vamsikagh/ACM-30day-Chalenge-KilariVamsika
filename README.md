## Daily Progress

| Day | Task Summary |
|-----|--------------|
| **Day 1** | Performed basic data cleaning and exploratory data analysis (EDA) on a burnout dataset. Handled missing values, explored distributions, and generated summary statistics. |
| **Day 2** | Applied preprocessing techniques for machine learning. Encoded categorical variables using OneHotEncoder and combined them with scaled numerical features to prepare the dataset for modeling. Performed Regression and decided which is best among three the types. |
| **Day 3** | Preprocessed data using one-hot encoding and scaling. Trained Logistic Regression and LDA models to classify burnout, then evaluated them using Accuracy, Confusion Matrix, and ROC-AUC with ROC curve visualization. |
| **Day 4**  | Trained Decision Tree, Random Forest, and k-NN models. Used Mutual Information to pick top 3 features and compared model accuracy before and after feature selection. |
